# Docs Partner Training resources

This subdirectory contains links and resources for training those who wish to contribute to [docs.microsoft.com](docs.microsoft.com). 

Here are some best practicwes for training partners:

1. A week or so in advance, set up a block of time (typically an hour) to provide training for the contributors
1. At that timne also send an introductory email to the contributors with a link to the [contributor's guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/Docs/tree/master/ContributorGuide), and ask that they preform the [tools and setup steps](https://github.com/Microsoft/Docs/blob/master/ContributorGuide/tools-and-setup.md) prior to the training. For those who entirely new to Git and Github, you may also suggest they take online training prior to the session:
   * The [Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) course from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com).
   * The [Try Git](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) course from [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com]).
   * [GitHub's 15-minue interactive primer](https://try.github.io/), [cheat sheets](https://training.github.com/kit/), and [links to formalized training](https://services.github.com/).
1. Use the firth third of your training session explaing Git and Github using the [training PowerPoint Presentation](git-github-workflow-training.pptx).
1. Use the second third of the training session to demostrate our workflow using Git Bash, a markdown editor, and Github, and insist that the trainees follow along using their own tools.  Have them:
   * Fork the repo.
   * Clone their fork locally.
   * Create aliases to upstream and origin, and embed their credentials in the commandline, using the git remote command
   * Sync their repo to upstream master
   * Create a branch and check it out
   * Edit and/or add one or more files
   * Add the file
   * Commit the files
   * Push the changes to Github
   * Go to Github and create a pull request
1. Leave the final third of the training session for questions (of which there will be many).
1. Follow up after the trasining to let the partners know that they can reply on you as a git/github/workflow SME.
1. Actively seek out opportunities for the partners to make small changes and contributions to the documentation.
