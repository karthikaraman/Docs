# Docs Partner Training resources

This subdirectory contains links and resources for training those who wish to contribute to [docs.microsoft.com](docs.microsoft.com). 

Here are some best practices for training partners:

## Beforehand

1. A week or so in advance, set up a block of time (typically an hour) to provide training for the contributors.
1. At that time also send an introductory email to the contributors with a link to the [contributor's guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/Docs/tree/master/ContributorGuide), and ask that they preform the [tools and setup steps](https://github.com/Microsoft/Docs/blob/master/ContributorGuide/tools-and-setup.md) prior to the training. For those who entirely new to Git and Github, you may also suggest they take online training prior to the session:
   * The [Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) course from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com).
   * The [Try Git](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) course from [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com]).
   * [GitHub's 15-minue interactive primer](https://try.github.io/), [cheat sheets](https://training.github.com/kit/), and [links to formalized training](https://services.github.com/).

   ## Training session

1. Use the firth third explaning Git and Github, using the [training PowerPoint Presentation](git-github-workflow-training.pptx).
1. Use the second third to demostrate our workflow using Git Bash, a markdown editor, and Github, and insist that the trainees follow along using their own tools.  Have them:
   * Fork the repo.
   * Clone their fork locally.
   * Create aliases to upstream and origin, and embed their credentials in the commandline, using the git remote command
   * Sync their repo to upstream master
   * Create a branch and check it out
   * Edit and/or add one or more files
   * Add the file
   * Commit the files
   * Push the changes to Github
   * Go to Github and create a pull request
   * View their changes in the staging site
1. Leave the final third of the training session for questions (of which there will be many).

## Afterwards

1. Follow up after the trasining to let the partners know that they can reply on you as a git/github/workflow SME.
1. Actively seek out opportunities for the partners to make small changes and contributions to the documentation.
